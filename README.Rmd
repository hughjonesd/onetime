# onetime

> Listen very carefully. I shall say this only once.

[Michelle Dubois, *'Allo 'Allo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-_5JJmNB6E)

The onetime package provides convenience functions to run R code only once 
(ever) per user. For example, you can:

* Show a startup message only the first time (ever) that a package is loaded. 
* Run cleanup code just once after an upgrade.
* Show the user a message, with the option not to show it again.

Onetime is a lightweight package. It requires just two package dependencies,
rappdirs and filelock, with no further indirect dependencies. The total 
size including these dependencies is less than 50 Kb.

* For more information, see the [vignette](https://hughjonesd.github.io/onetime/dev/articles/onetime.html).

* Development documentation is at <https://hughjonesd.github.io/onetime/dev/>.  

```{r, child = "example.Rmd"} 
```
