New submission to deal with a change to package documentation
(see https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/1491). Some new
functionality is included.

Cheers,

## R CMD check results

* Checked on:
  - Local MacOS, R 4.3.0
  - github Windows/MacOS/Linux
  - Appveyor Windows
  - CRAN Macbuilder
  - CRAN Winbuilder

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* Winbuilder has a note about "lockfiles" being misspelt. I say this is a false
  positive. We all know what a lockfile is, and a "lock file" would sound 
  confusing.
